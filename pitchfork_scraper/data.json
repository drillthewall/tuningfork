{"albumName": "i,i", "artist": "Bon Iver", "score": "8.8", "text": " Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon \u2019s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self. There\u2019s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here\u2014impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks\u2014and they are buoyed by Vernon\u2019s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don\u2019t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world. The lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. \u201cI like you/And that ain\u2019t nothing new,\u201d he sings simply on \u201ciMi.\u201d Later, on \u201cRABi,\u201d he observes, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all just scared of dying.\u201d These things don\u2019t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like \u201cMarion\u201d and \u201cHolyfields,\u201d are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed. Still, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak \u2019s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he\u2019d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single \u201cU (Man Like),\u201d but his presence is enlivening. It\u2019s less lonely to have friends nearby. Vernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He\u2019s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like \u201cNaeem\u201d is filled with production flourishes\u2014a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver \u2019s \u201cPerth\u201d\u2014yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon\u2019s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to \u201cNaeem\u201d are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (\u201cI fall off a bass boat/And the concrete\u2019s very slow\u201d), but he isn\u2019t hiding behind them. It\u2019s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On \u201cNaeem,\u201d he sings, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll be passing on/Tell them we\u2019re young mastodons,\u201d dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up. Like all the best moments in his catalog, it is inexplicably touching. i,i is often about trying to reconnect with some idea of a true self, even as you move forward. Vernon writes of scars and things lost: \u201cYou were young when you were gave it,\u201d he sings on \u201cWe,\u201d a line that speaks to his ability to summon powerful elegiac feelings with a few simple words. \u201cHey, Ma,\u201d immediately one of the best songs in the Bon Iver catalog, is rousing and explicitly sentimental. \u201cFull time you talk your money up/While it\u2019s living in a coal mine,\u201d Vernon belts, but his voice is too earthy to sound hateful. Instead, it\u2019s like he\u2019s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster. At first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million. Upon listening, though, you realize that many of these are probably mondegreens and homonyms, cheeky nods to how hard it is to understand Bon Iver\u2019s lyrics. \u201cJelmore,\u201d for instance, is a fragment of what it sounds like when Vernon sings, \u201cWell angel morning sivanna.\u201d And the title for the closing \u201cRABi\u201d comes from the couplet, \u201cI could prophet/I could rob I, however.\u201d There are plenty of interpretive possibilities available in those words, but none of them are as enticing as their sheer sound. The music is also not as mysterious as the songs\u2019 monikers suggest. There\u2019s an overwhelming calmness and pleasantness to i,i, and \u201cRABi\u201d is one of the most easygoing of the bunch. \u201cSunlight feels good now don\u2019t it,\u201d Vernon sings. There\u2019s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. \u201cI don\u2019t have a leaving plan,\u201d he sings, maybe because there\u2019s nowhere else he needs to go.

Instead, it\u2019s like he\u2019s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster. At first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million.

There\u2019s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. \u201cI don\u2019t have a leaving plan,\u201d he sings, maybe because there\u2019s nowhere else he needs to go.

{"albumName": "i,i", "artist": "Bon Iver", "score": "8.8", "text": " Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon \u2019s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self. There\u2019s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here\u2014impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks\u2014and they are buoyed by Vernon\u2019s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don\u2019t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world. The lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. \u201cI like you/And that ain\u2019t nothing new,\u201d he sings simply on \u201ciMi.\u201d Later, on \u201cRABi,\u201d he observes, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all just scared of dying.\u201d These things don\u2019t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like \u201cMarion\u201d and \u201cHolyfields,\u201d are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed. Still, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak \u2019s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he\u2019d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single \u201cU (Man Like),\u201d but his presence is enlivening. It\u2019s less lonely to have friends nearby. Vernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He\u2019s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like \u201cNaeem\u201d is filled with production flourishes\u2014a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver \u2019s \u201cPerth\u201d\u2014yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon\u2019s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to \u201cNaeem\u201d are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (\u201cI fall off a bass boat/And the concrete\u2019s very slow\u201d), but he isn\u2019t hiding behind them. It\u2019s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On \u201cNaeem,\u201d he sings, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll be passing on/Tell them we\u2019re young mastodons,\u201d dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up.
