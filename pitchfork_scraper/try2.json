{"album": "i,i", "artist": "Bon Iver", "score": "8.8", "genre": "Rock", "reviewer": "Matthew Strauss", "text": " Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon \u2019s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self. There\u2019s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here\u2014impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks\u2014and they are buoyed by Vernon\u2019s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don\u2019t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world. The lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. \u201cI like you/And that ain\u2019t nothing new,\u201d he sings simply on \u201ciMi.\u201d Later, on \u201cRABi,\u201d he observes, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all just scared of dying.\u201d These things don\u2019t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like \u201cMarion\u201d and \u201cHolyfields,\u201d are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed. Still, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak \u2019s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he\u2019d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single \u201cU (Man Like),\u201d but his presence is enlivening. It\u2019s less lonely to have friends nearby. Vernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He\u2019s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like \u201cNaeem\u201d is filled with production flourishes\u2014a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver \u2019s \u201cPerth\u201d\u2014yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon\u2019s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to \u201cNaeem\u201d are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (\u201cI fall off a bass boat/And the concrete\u2019s very slow\u201d), but he isn\u2019t hiding behind them. It\u2019s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On \u201cNaeem,\u201d he sings, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll be passing on/Tell them we\u2019re young mastodons,\u201d dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up. Like all the best moments in his catalog, it is inexplicably touching. i,i is often about trying to reconnect with some idea of a true self, even as you move forward. Vernon writes of scars and things lost: \u201cYou were young when you were gave it,\u201d he sings on \u201cWe,\u201d a line that speaks to his ability to summon powerful elegiac feelings with a few simple words. \u201cHey, Ma,\u201d immediately one of the best songs in the Bon Iver catalog, is rousing and explicitly sentimental. \u201cFull time you talk your money up/While it\u2019s living in a coal mine,\u201d Vernon belts, but his voice is too earthy to sound hateful. Instead, it\u2019s like he\u2019s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster. At first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million. Upon listening, though, you realize that many of these are probably mondegreens and homonyms, cheeky nods to how hard it is to understand Bon Iver\u2019s lyrics. \u201cJelmore,\u201d for instance, is a fragment of what it sounds like when Vernon sings, \u201cWell angel morning sivanna.\u201d And the title for the closing \u201cRABi\u201d comes from the couplet, \u201cI could prophet/I could rob I, however.\u201d There are plenty of interpretive possibilities available in those words, but none of them are as enticing as their sheer sound. The music is also not as mysterious as the songs\u2019 monikers suggest. There\u2019s an overwhelming calmness and pleasantness to i,i, and \u201cRABi\u201d is one of the most easygoing of the bunch. \u201cSunlight feels good now don\u2019t it,\u201d Vernon sings. There\u2019s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. \u201cI don\u2019t have a leaving plan,\u201d he sings, maybe because there\u2019s nowhere else he needs to go.

{"album": "Whities 023 (The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor)", "artist": ["Carl Gari", "Abdullah Miniawy"], "year": " ", "score": "7.6", "genre": ["Experimental"], "reviewer": "Andy Beta", "text": " Early in 2016, Will Bankhead\u2019s eclectic electronic label The Trilogy Tapes dropped a thrilling run of club-melting 12\"s from Rezzett, Four Legs, and Call Super \u2019s Ondo Fudd alias. Slotted among these was an eerie, queasy release credited to Carl Gari and Abdullah Miniawy, with a stark photograph of Tahrir Square and the scorched exterior of the former parliament building in Cairo. The music matched that smoldering, post-revolutionary scene; the heavy atmosphere of the country and the bitterness of the military dictatorship resonated in haunting drones, ominous throbs, and a voice incanting in digitally processed Arabic. Despite what the credits suggested, it was not a duo, but rather a spontaneous collaboration between the German electronic trio Carl Gari and Egyptian singer/trumpeter Abdullah Miniawy. Three years on, Carl Gari and Miniawy emerge on another trailblazing English imprint, Nic Tasker\u2019s Whities, again offering a bewildering, heart-shaking detour from normal club fare. The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor is a harrowing and desolate listen that captures the mood and mindset of Miniawy and numerous other Egyptians living under the brutal oppression of the Al-Sisi regime. Miniawy only escaped by fleeing to France. The move makes for a less hurried collaboration than the group\u2019s debut, which the musicians recorded in Cairo after their first meeting; these recordings took place at a remote house in the Bavarian forest. Even if the meaning of Miniawy\u2019s lyrics escapes non-Arabic speakers, Carl Gari amplify their poetry with bleak, turbid electronics bringing to mind Joy Division and post-industrial soundscapes transported from Europe to North Africa. The dread-filled throb of \u201cHaj\u201d recalls the Scott Walker-penned \u201c The Electrician,\u201d from 1978, which itself put the brutal right-wing regimes of Chile and Argentina into song form. But where that song pressurized until it finally burst at the chorus, here Carl Gari and Miniawy make the atmosphere more leaden, the pressure inescapable. In a broken voice, Miniawy\u2019s words suggest volumes in only a few lines: \u201cI beg you, man who ploughs/If I left after being a witness to the accident/Please don\u2019t erase its traces.\u201d With its sluggish drum machines, minor-key synths, and heavy guitar reverb, \u201cZawaj\u201d suggests the dour gloom of early Portishead emanating from a more desperate time, Miniawy\u2019s voice pushing through the morass and soaring over the rubble. The centerpiece of the six-track release is \u201cB\u2019aj \u0628\u0639\u0627\u062c,\u201d pairing metallic drones with a poem by Miniawy that follows a man\u2019s fall from an eighth-floor window. Against a beat like an electric wire scraping against corrugated metal (echoing the sparse, desolate percussion of Joy Division\u2019s \u201cDecades\u201d), his delivery is straightforward as he details how he plunges past each floor of his building. His downward path charts a microcosm of Egyptian society, everyday scenes that take on a fraught aspect; as the facade of home life slips, despair surges to the surface. There\u2019s the fleeting image of a skipping rope that turns into a hangman\u2019s noose, the tactile feel of fingernails against metal, a vertiginous succession of slides. All these details, these little failures, add up to convey a broader sense of dread, depression, and societal collapse. But rather than offering the release of final impact, as the narrator reaches the end, Miniawy howls the kicker: \u201cHigh diving from the first floor/Taking you again to floor number nine.\u201d It\u2019s a damnation worse than death, the very act of falling turned into its own Sisyphean hell. The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor is a gripping soundtrack to the inner despair not only of Egyptians, but anyone feeling bereft of hope in the modern world\u2014a sound that keeps growing louder.", "italic": ["The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor", "The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor"], "links": ["Call Super", "Carl Gari", "Abdullah Miniawy", "The Electrician"], "albumLinks": [], "artistLinks": ["Call Super", "Carl Gari", "Abdullah Miniawy"]}

Even if the meaning of Miniawy\u2019s lyrics escapes non-Arabic speakers, Carl Gari amplify their poetry with bleak, turbid electronics bringing to mind Joy Division and post-industrial soundscapes transported from Europe to North Africa. The dread-filled throb of \u201cHaj\u201d recalls the Scott Walker-penned \u201c The Electrician,\u201d from 1978, which itself put the brutal right-wing regimes of Chile and Argentina into song form. But where that song pressurized until it finally burst at the chorus, here Carl Gari and Miniawy make the atmosphere more leaden, the pressure inescapable. In a broken voice, Miniawy\u2019s words suggest volumes in only a few lines: \u201cI beg you, man who ploughs/If I left after being a witness to the accident/Please don\u2019t erase its traces.\u201d With its sluggish drum machines, minor-key synths, and heavy guitar reverb, \u201cZawaj\u201d suggests the dour gloom of early Portishead emanating from a more desperate time, Miniawy\u2019s voice pushing through the morass and soaring over the rubble. The centerpiece of the six-track release is \u201cB\u2019aj \u0628\u0639\u0627\u062c,\u201d pairing metallic drones with a poem by Miniawy that follows a man\u2019s fall from an eighth-floor window. Against a beat like an electric wire scraping against corrugated metal (echoing the sparse, desolate percussion of Joy Division\u2019s \u201cDecades\u201d), his delivery is straightforward as he details how he plunges past each floor of his building. His downward path charts a microcosm of Egyptian society, everyday scenes that take on a fraught aspect; as the facade of home life slips, despair surges to the surface. There\u2019s the fleeting image of a skipping rope that turns into a hangman\u2019s noose, the tactile feel of fingernails against metal, a vertiginous succession of slides. All these details, these little failures, add up to convey a broader sense of dread, depression, and societal collapse. But rather than offering the release of final impact, as the narrator reaches the end, Miniawy howls the kicker: \u201cHigh diving from the first floor/Taking you again to floor number nine.\u201d It\u2019s a damnation worse than death, the very act of falling turned into its own Sisyphean hell. The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor is a gripping soundtrack to the inner despair not only of Egyptians, but anyone feeling bereft of hope in the modern world\u2014a sound that keeps growing louder.", "italic": ["The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor", "The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor"], "links": ["Call Super", "Carl Gari", "Abdullah Miniawy", "The Electrician"], "albumLinks": [], "artistLinks": ["Call Super", "Carl Gari", "Abdullah Miniawy"]}

He carefully crafted a narrative of corner-hustler-turned-corporate-CEO while guarding the intimate secrets of those closest to him; she was a perfectly manicured pop star who built an empire on turning the vagaries of life into empowerment anthems. Lemonade and 4:44 were watershed moments because they offered a glimpse of the more vulnerable traits of the mystical artists behind them. The Carters zoomed in close enough to show the cracks\u2014to hear a man struggling to find maturity and a woman searching for clarity. Through those albums, we were allowed to see their flaws and we formed deeper connections to them because of it. Their surprise joint release, Everything Is Love, completes the arc. It\u2019s a testament to how a complicated love survived through self-reflection, compromise, and ruthless honesty. The quintessential power couple has reemerged to stunt on everyone\u2014haters, mistresses, America itself\u2014while serving up a spectacle of romance and opulence like make-up sex on a bed of money. The Carters\u2019 final episode of a presumed trilogy packages truth in a way that makes it more captivating than any lie or tabloid fodder. Elevator fights, rumors of discord, and marriage counseling swirled around their initial \u201cOn the Run\u201d tour in 2014. It took another two years to confirm the suspicion, and by then, it was near impossible to look away from their turmoil. But even now, with drama in the rear view, the return of marital harmony still holds a thrill. Opening track \u201cSUMMER\u201d picks up where Lemonade \u2019s \u201cAll Night\u201d left off, a slow dance with the warm sensuality of forgiveness. Above a soulful live band, Beyonc\u00e9 croons sweetly about making love to her husband, but it\u2019s one of the few times she\u2019ll play the part of the mellifluous singer. This is \u201c don't think I'm just his little wife \u201d writ large and there is little room for honeyed words; Bey is fired up and in rare form. The couple\u2019s happily ever after is a celebration of both resilient black love (to the chagrin of those for whom infidelity is irredeemable) and proud black extravagance (to the chagrin of those who for whom money is not freedom). As quickly as the opener\u2019s majestic strings fade out, the thunderous \u201c APESHIT \u201d rumbles in. And so continues the second life of Beyonc\u00e9, your favorite rapper\u2019s favorite rapper. She kicks triplet flows all over Pharrell\u2019s club-ready production, accented by Quavo and Offset ad-libs. She raps in double time, crashing the syllables into each other: \u201cPut some respeck on my check/Or pay me in equity/Watch me reverse out of debt (skrt!).\u201d Jay is an afterthought on the song despite seamlessly integrating Chief Keef\u2019s \u201cFaneto,\u201d The Lion King, and some well-placed Grammys and NFL shade in the span of his verse: \u201cEvery night we in the end zone/Tell the NFL we in stadiums too.\u201d And what audacity to film the video for a trap banger in the Louvre\u2014the pinnacle of violent colonial history presented as high art\u2014and to call it \u201c APE SHIT,\u201d and to fill the place with black creators who are rarely revered on the walls. Each frame of melanin situated against white space is a gorgeous piece of art unto itself. Everything Is Love largely doubles down on the status symbols, generational wealth, and sustainability put forth in songs like \u201cFamily Feud\u201d and \u201cLegacy\u201d from 4:44. Bey\u2019s line on \u201cBOSS\u201d\u2014\u201dMy great-great-grandchildren already rich/That\u2019s a lot of brown chil\u2019run on your Forbes list\u201d\u2014is the best of many flexes on the album. Likewise, Jay\u2019s assertion on the same song that \u201cOver here we measure success by how many people successful next to you/Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you\u201d echoes a form of cooperative economics. Communal connections thread the album, coming to a head on the sinuous \u201cFRIENDS\u201d which finds the Carters recognizing comrades (and frenemies, probably) as the bedrock of their prosperity. When \u201cdid it on my own\u201d rhetoric is still the go-to for success stories, Jay and Beyonc\u00e9 pausing to honor those in their orbit who ground them is as admirable as it is relatable. By and large, though, they hold the focus on themselves, staying in one another\u2019s sight and playing off each other in a manner far removed from the honeymoon phase of \u201c\u201903 Bonnie & Clyde\u201d or \u201cCrazy in Love.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even need to say anything else when he beams \u201cit\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 nigga, oh my god\u201d on the synth-pop jam \u201cHEARD ABOUT US.\u201d Their peak synergy and star power make Everything Is Love an event, but Jay is the moon to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s sun. He has shown his spectacular bravado for 20 years, but we\u2019re still getting accustomed to Bey, a woman of action over words, really talking her shit. She\u2019s radiant here, a balladeer and trap rapper, an around-the-way girl and reigning queen all rolled into one. She works in nods to the stoner comedy Half Baked, Notorious B.I.G., Shawty Lo/Young Jeezy, and Dr. Dre by singing the hook of \u201c Still D.R.E.,\u201d a track her husband helped write. Her limberness on the album makes one of the best rappers to ever live look like a one-trick pony by comparison. The Carters remain billionaires who are not interested in leaving their blackness behind, and that, in some ways, is renegade\u2014even if capitalism isn\u2019t salvation. It\u2019s what makes a song like \u201cBLACK EFFECT,\u201d an explicit ode to black excellence set to a soulful soundscape courtesy of Miami producer duo Cool & Dre, so powerful. They\u2019re still using their platform to acknowledge the history\u2014through the names Kalief Browder, Trayvon Martin, Sarah Baartman, MLK, Malcolm X\u2014and the current condition of black people through affirmation and critiques of appropriation and police brutality. As director Ava DuVernay wrote in 2011 of Jay and Kanye\u2019s Watch the Throne: \u201cTell me who has \u2019made it\u2019 to the highest heights and then started speaking the truth about the beauty of us, Black Folk, our souls, our bodies, our brains.\u201d Of course, Kanye has reneged, but Jay and Bey remain committed to championing our lives and experiences. Everything Is Love is a compromise between the spoils of Lemonade \u2019s war and the fruits of 4:44 \u2019s labor. Jay and Bey extend an invitation to join their very public vow-renewal victory lap because we now know what it costs to get here and how expensive having it all can be. It may not be collective liberation (and why should it be?), but it is theirs. When Beyonc\u00e9 declares, \u201cWe came and we saw and we conquered it all\u201d on playful closer \u201cLOVEHAPPY,\u201d it\u2019s her final exhale, her reclamation of her throne of love pulled straight from the tongue of colonizers. Within this complex, messy and beautifully black display, the Carters find absolution.", "italic": ["Everything Is Love", "Lemonade", "skrt", "The Lion King", "APE", "Everything Is Love", "4:44", "Everything Is Love", "Half Baked", "then", "Everything Is Love", "Lemonade", "4:44"], "links": ["JAY-Z", "Beyonc\u00e9", "Lemonade", "4:44", "don't think I'm just his little wife", "APESHIT", "the video", "Still D.R.E.", "wrote", "Watch the Throne"], "albumLinks": ["Lemonade", "4:44", "APESHIT", "Watch the Throne"], "artistLinks": ["JAY-Z", "Beyonc\u00e9"]}
